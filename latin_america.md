# Latin America Testbed

The Latin America Testbed is comprised of four intercomparisons:
1. Lightning nowcasting over South America
2. Precipitation nowcasting over South America
3. Lightning nowcasting over Mexico
4. Precipitation nowcasting over Mexico

## South America domains

The precipitation nowcasting intercomparison in South America will be at high resolution for a particular radar (see the green circle).
The lightning nowcasting intercomparison will be for the entire image below.

## Mexico domain

The domain for both the precipitation and lightning nowcasting intercomparisons will be over the image below.

## Lightning Nowcasting Intercomparison

### Problem

The problem we are trying to solve is predicting lightning in 120 minutes following a given time. We use GOES-East Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) data as the truth data. Specificially, the maximum 10-minute flash-extent density over the ensuing 60 or 120 minutes.
Since we are trying to only predict the occurrence of any lightning (i.e. â‰¥ 1 flash), the flash-extent density fields can be binarized into lightning masks. Predictions are in units of "probability of **any** lightning" within a given time frame.

After reading this wiki, see [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CTz2oMtHW_5m6YZAqJRwa0hp3nFTOm_3#scrollTo=aSNRqLueWA15) for some examples on working with the data.

### The Dataset

The dataset can be found on zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/14261376). The initial version of this dataset is for 30 days for each domain:

South America: 5th - 9th of September 2023 through February 2024
Mexico: 5th - 9th of April 2024 through September 2024

#### Target Data

As stated above, the targets are 120-minute accumlations of GLM flash-extent density. It has 10-minute temporal resolution and 0.1-deg-lat by 0.1-deg-lon spatial resolution. The data are netCDF4 format.

Here is an example target/truth filename: `FED-accum-120min-10km_s20230905-000000_e20230905-020000.nc`

- `FED-accum-120min-10km` is the truth metric. In this case, "flash-extent density accumulation in 120 minutes at 10-km resolution".
- `s20230905-000000` is the start time of the accumulation in UTC. The format is `sYYYYmmdd-HHMMSS`.
- `e20230905-020000` is the end time of the accumulation in UTC. The format is `eYYYYmmdd-HHMMSS`.

```
netcdf FED-accum-120min-10km_s20230905-000000_e20230905-020000 {

	x = 501 ;
	y = 611 ;

		FED-accum-120min-2km:long_name = "Max flash-extent density in previous 120 min" ;

}
```

#### Example Prediction Data

The example prediction data come from the [NOAA/CIMSS LightningCast](https://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/severe_conv/pltg.html) model. Predictions from this satellite-based deep-learning model are remapped to the truth/target resolutions (10-minute, 0.1 x 0.1 degrees). The prediction data are also found on Zenodo.

Here is an example file for predictions: `predictions_LTG_NOAA_s20230905-000020_e20230905-020020.nc`.

- `predictions` just means these are prediction files.
- `LTG` indicates that these are predictions for lightning, as opposed to `QPF`.
- `NOAA` is the source model or institution, in this example.
- `s20230905-000020` is the start time of the accumulation in UTC. The format is `sYYYYmmdd-HHMMSS`.
- `e20230905-020020` is the end time of the accumulation in UTC. The format is `eYYYYmmdd-HHMMSS`.
