The Artificial Intelligence for Nowcasting Pilot Project (AINPP), envisioned as a WMO WIPPS pilot project, emerges in a critical era where high-impact weather events are increasingly affecting socio-economic developments worldwide. These events present significant challenges, especially in developing countries of the tropics, due to the inherent low predictability of convective storms, limitations in weather forecasting capabilities and resource constraints. 

## Objectives
The objective of this pilot project is to assess the viability and impacts of using AI methods for severe weather nowcasting and to apply the AI-based nowcasting products in targeted developing countries to support them in the implementation of the Early Warning for All initiative.

It will provide best practice cases and guidelines of using AI to enhance nowcasting for developing countries. One or two potential Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres (RSMCs) for nowcasting will be found with the capability of providing AI-based nowcasting products to enhance the regional nowcasting capacity. AI-based nowcasting operational workflow will be established in targeted developing countries, if possible.
